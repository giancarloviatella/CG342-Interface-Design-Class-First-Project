                If Nobuo Uematsu’s career was a video game, he beat it a long time ago. The world’s most prestigious orchestras have performed his music from the Final Fantasy series to cheering crowds. Grammy-winning hip-hop producer Knxwledge has flipped his MIDI melodies into slick beats. Musician Jon Batiste has transformed his favorite Final Fantasy songs into big band jazz arrangements and played them to millions of viewers on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.” (Batiste’s favorite video gamesoundtrack is “Final Fantasy VII,” in case you’re wondering.) What does Uematsu do next? It’s something that the veteran video game composer has finally found sometime to reflect on in light of the famed JRPG series’s 35th anniversary.The last game he composed a complete soundtrack for was 2021’s “Fantasian,” an Apple Arcade exclusive created by his friend and Final Fantasy creator, Hironobu Sakaguchi, and it might be his last.<br>

                Both Colette Bennett and I had the honor of meeting and interviewing Final Fantasy series composer Nobuo Uematsu, who was joined by Distant Worlds conductor Arnie Roth. The pair took time out of their busy schedule in the middle of preparing for their next concert in Grand Rapids, Michigan to talk to us about games, music making, boss battles, concertgoers and more. The interview gradually becomes unconventional, as we chat with the famed composer about beer, business men, and the best moves from Final Fantasy VII to have in your personal arsenal. Luckily enough, he didn’t think we were totally crazy. In fact, it seemed as if he was glad to play along. I have to admit that it was hard for both of us to remain professional, as we are both huge fans of the 20 year game music veteran. Fortunately, Uematsu is an easy-going, fun-loving guy who, now that I think about it, could probably see right through us. He knew we were gaming geeks. Regardless, we had fun. Read on for the full interview with Nobuo Uematsu.<br>
