<p>
    Arriving back on Earth, EVE repairs WALL路E, but finds that his memory and personality have been erased.
    Heartbroken, EVE gives WALL路E a goodbye "kiss", which restores him to his normal self.
    WALL路E and EVE reunite as the inhabitants of the Axiom take their first steps on Earth.
    Humans and robots turn the ravaged planet into a paradise, and the plant grows into a mighty tree, which EVE and
    WALL路E rest beneath.
